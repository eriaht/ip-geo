# ip-geo
This script uses the traceroute or tracert tool (depending on your system OS) and outputs the city name and country of each router along the way.

### Troubleshooting
If the script seems to be "hung up" check the tracerouteout.txt file look for * in the output. The * indicates that a response was not received at that hop, the request will time out for 5 seconds before sending another request. Wait for tracert to finish or press control + C to end the program.

```
pip3 install requests
python ip_geo.py --ip=150.31.249.103 
```

### Options
```
-w : Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe.
    Usage: python ip_geo.py --ip=150.31.249.103 -w=1
-m : Set the max_ttl (max number of hops) used in outgoing probe packets.
    Usage: python ip_geo.py --ip=150.31.249.103 -m=15

Combine both: python ip_geo.py --ip=150.31.249.103 -w=1 -m=15
```
